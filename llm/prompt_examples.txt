The following is worth to test once:


def build_prompt(self, question: str) -> str:
        """
        Build a prompt for Llama 3.1_8b to answer a single question concisely.
        """
        return (
            "<|im_start|>system\n"
            "You are a concise assistant. "
            "Answer in exactly one sentence. "
            "Do not repeat the question. Do not add greetings or commentary. "
            "Do not ask the user anything back.\n"
            "<|im_end|>\n"
            "<|im_start|>user\n"
            f"Question: {question}\n"
            "<|im_end|>\n"
            "<|im_start|>assistant\n"
        )

******************************************************************

Originial Tinyllama prompt. But looks like the new one works better:

return (
            "\nYou are a helpful assistant.\n"
            "Answer the following question in **one sentence only**.\n"
            "Do not add extra text, do not repeat the question, and do not generate any new questions.\n\n"
            f"Question: {question}\n"
            "Answer:"
        )
